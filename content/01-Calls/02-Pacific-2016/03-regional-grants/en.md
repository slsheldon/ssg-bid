# Regional grants

_Pacific, 2016_

Regional grants under the BID programme seek to establish or strengthen international collaborations that increase biodiversity data mobilization.

These guidelines are available in English, Spanish and French, of which the English version is the authoritative version. They are intended to assist applicants in completing the BID concept note template. General questions may be sent to [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org).

-----------------------

## Submission procedure

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from the Pacific is **10 November 2016**.

+ Applications must be submitted using the concept note template to [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org) by 10 November 2016, 9:00am CET / 8:00am UTC/GMT. 
+ Confirmed project partners must be copied when submitting the application. 
+ As appropriate, include a statement of endorsement from a GBIF representative in submissions as an email attachment. 
+ **Applications must be submitted in English and by using the** [**concept note template**](/raw/BID-Concept-Note-Template-Pacific.docx).  If you need help with this requirement, please contact [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org) as early as possible and before 20 October 2016. 

Please note that the evaluation panel will not be review late or incomplete applications.

## Objectives

The objectives of the BID regional biodiversity data mobilization grants are to:
+ Establish or strengthen international collaborations to mobilize biodiversity data
+ Increase available biodiversity data, within and beyond the grant period
+ Apply biodiversity data in response to conservation priorities

The overall BID programme targets two key outcomes:
1. Enhanced capacity for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity information
2. Enhanced availability of information resources and best practice guidance for mobilization and application of biodiversity information for key policy needs

## Evaluation criteria

Proposals will be assessed using the following criteria:

1. Alignment of the project with BID objectives and priorities.
2. Alignment of the project with clearly stated needs for biodiversity information and capacity development within the proposal.
3. The project’s complementary contributions to regional data needs.
4. Likelihood that the project will provide examples of best practice in the application of biodiversity information in decision-making.
5. Quantity, quality and relevance of the biodiversity data proposed for mobilization, with preference given to projects that mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species and invasive alien species.
6. Level of national support and cost-effectiveness of the proposed actions; the balance between the level of funding requested from BID and the co-funding contributed by the project partners.
7. Anticipated value of the project deliverables to both the national and regional context and the broader GBIF community.
8. Choice and diversity of project partners, with preference given to projects that have the confirmed involvement of a diverse network of data holders and data users.

NOTE: Full proposals will also assess a) project management skills of coordinating team based on previous experience, b) quality of project design and risk assessment; c) monitoring and evaluation plans; and d) sustainability plan.

-----------

## Project duration

Selected projects may begin their activities in April 2017. 

Projects may run for up to 18 months and must end by September 2018, followed by a final three-month reporting and evaluation period ending in December 2018. 

Grantees must complete all projects by 31 December 2018.

-----------

## Funding

A regional consortium must involve partners from a minimum of three different countries or overseas territories from the region. The consortium coordinator and at least one other partner must be located in an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries). Each partner may receive up to €20,000, and one consortium coordinator may receive up to €10,000 in additional funding to coordinate the activities of the partners.

Regional consortia may include one partner from outside the region. Institutions from countries outside the region and those with limited eligibility may apply for up to €10,000 in funding from the BID programme as part of a regional consortium.

During the course of the BID programme, the maximum total project funding that any single applicant can receive is €60,000.

## Regional grant activity types

Regional grants must include activities contributing to each of three component categories. Each category presented below includes a non-exclusive list of possible types of activity:

**1. Establishing or strengthening networks to support long-term data mobilization and inter-institutional data sharing**
+ Assessing biodiversity data holdings and user needs through a survey or study to develop a strategy for the consortium
+ Organizing regional workshops to promote inter-institutional collaboration.
+ Formalizing partnerships through institutional agreements, data sharing policies and public endorsement of mobilization strategies
+ Adopting a data publishing process, possibly including installing data publishing informatics tools (e.g. [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit](http://www.gbif.org/ipt))
+ Training data managers and collections staff within key data holding institutions on data mobilization and management, for example, through workshops to share the knowledge gained through attending the two BID capacity enhancement workshops

**2. Activities to mobilize biodiversity data relevant to protected areas, invasive alien species and/or threatened species**
+ Compiling inventories of biodiversity data holdings (for example, implementing metadata catalogues)
+ Digitizing and publishing natural history collections and biodiversity information from literature
+ Mobilizing species occurrence and sampling-event data from observation networks and monitoring systems, such as invasive alien species, Red Listed species or endemic species
+ Validating and publishing regional, national and local species checklists, invasive species lists or threatened species lists
+ Preparing [data papers](http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/data-papers) to improve the reusability of the mobilized biodiversity data

**3. Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes**
+ Leading surveys or workshops to understand the biodiversity data requirements for specific use cases.
+ Setting up user groups to guide project implementation on identified priority themes, such as agrobiodiversity, urban biodiversity and protected areas.
+ Directing workshops and advocacy actions that promote the use of openly accessible data, for example, in national-level biodiversity reporting.
+ Hosting workshops on data analysis techniques.
+ Applying biodiversity data in decision-making processes.
+ Documenting use cases and sharing them with partners in the region.

## General recommendations for preparing concept notes

+ **Ensure that your project meets the eligibility criteria and aligns well with the overall objectives for the programme**. Consider the evaluation criteria used by the evaluation panel to assess your proposal.
+ **Be brief**. Try to provide the shortest responses possible and only add background information if really needed, using links to external resources rather than long explanations.
+ **Prepare your submissions in English**. The evaluation panel will use English as their working language and therefore applicants are requested to make submissions in English. Remember that if you have particular difficulties with this requirement, contact [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org) for support as early as possible, and before 20 October 2016.
+ **Review the FAQ**. [This page](../faq) will be updated throughout the project application period. Send any unanswered questions to [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org). 
+ **Submit as early as possible to avoid problems**. Early submission will give a chance for some follow-up to resolve any issues that arise ahead of the deadline. The deadline for submissions is a hard deadline, and projects received late or incomplete will not be reviewed by the evaluation panel.
