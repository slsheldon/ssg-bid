# Eligibility

In addition to meeting role-dependent location requirements in an [eligible country](../eligible-countries), organizations seeking funding through the BID programme must meet both general and grant-specific eligibility requirements outlined below.

-----------------------

## General eligibility criteria<a name="general"></a>

All applications for BID grants must comply with the following general eligibility criteria:

1. Complete concept notes and full proposals in English must be received by the stated deadlines.
2. All confirmed project partners must have completed [one of the BID surveys](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/BID-pacific-survey). These surveys are aimed at decision-makers and biodiversity data holders in the Pacific ACP countries and seek to understand biodiversity data needs and resources in the region.
3. Applicants must be legal entities located in an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries). Such entities include national government agencies, GBIF Participant nodes, natural history museums and collections, research institutes, universities, and NGOs.
4. Applications involving partners from countries or organizations that already participate in GBIF must include a statement of endorsement from the GBIF Head of Delegation or Node Manager. Contact information for representatives of GBIF Participants can be found on the individual Participant pages linked from the [Participant list](http://www.gbif.org/participation/participant-list).
5. All BID funded activities must be not-for-profit. BID programme funds may be used to support staff time, travel and costs associated with the organization of meetings and workshops, and limited costs for IT services and equipment. 
6. Overhead costs may not be charged to BID grants.
7. All proposed project activities must fall within the stated implementation periods for each grant type.
8. Applicants must commit co-funding (in-kind or cash) to their projects and provide details of this co-funding in their concept notes and full proposals. Co-funding refers to real costs that are incurred by the applicants while executing the funded project’s activities. These could be in-kind contributions directly contributing to the project activities (like staff salaries, travel costs etc.) or any in-cash contributions to BID activities from other funding sources. 
9. If invited to submit a full proposal, applicants must prepare a detailed budget. Note that BID funds cannot be used to pay for bank transfer fees, exchange rate fees and courier costs for delivering the contract and project reports to GBIF.
10. If invited to submit a full proposal, applicants must provide plans to ensure sustainability of activities after project support from BID concludes. 
11. All data mobilized through the BID grants, as well as any other products of the projects, such as training material, must be made available under a [CC-BY license or CC0 license](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/data-licensing-and-endorsement).

-----------------------

## Regional grant eligibility

In addition to complying with the [general eligibility criteria](#general) above, applications for regional biodiversity data mobilization grants must comply with the following criteria:

1. All projects must include activities contributing to each of the three component categories:
  + Establishing or strengthening networks to support long-term data mobilization and inter-institutional data sharing
  + Activities to mobilize biodiversity data
  + Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes
2. The consortium coordinator responsible for organizing project activities on behalf of the consortium partners and other project collaborators must submit the concept note. The consortium coordinator must be a legal entity from an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries). The consortium coordinator may apply for additional support for activities related to the coordination of the consortium, up to a maximum of €10,000. Applications must explain how the consortium coordinator will coordinate the activities of the partners.
3. Applications must include at least three consortium partners including the consortium coordinator, each from a different [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries). All consortium partners must have confirmed their participation in the project and must be copied when concept notes and full proposals are submitted. Projects must involve users of biodiversity data as project partners, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. These must be representatives of legal entities located in an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries).
4. Regional consortia may also include one partner from outside the region.
5. If invited to submit a full project proposal, applicants must copy all confirmed project partners with the submission. Letters of support from confirmed project partners should be included as attachments to email submissions of full proposals.
6.	All projects must include a major component of data mobilization through the GBIF network. It is expected that most BID funding will be directed towards data mobilization. As a guideline for the national grants, the amount of BID funding spent on data mobilization activities should not be less than 60% of the total grant.
7.	BID funds may be used to cover up to 50% of the costs of any IT services or purchases, up to a maximum of €2,500 of any national grant. Receipts have to be provided in financial reports.

  + Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes
2. The project coordinator responsible for coordinating activities on behalf of the project partners must submit the concept note. The coordinator’s host institution must be a legal entity from an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries). The coordinator will have lead responsibility for managing the grant and reporting on both project and financial activities.
3. Applications must include at least two relevant national institutes, agencies or non-governmental organizations as project partners.
4. Projects must involve users of biodiversity data as project partners, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. These must be representatives of legal entities located in an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries).
5. If invited to submit a full proposal, applicants must copy all confirmed project partners with the submission. Letters of support from confirmed project partners should be also included as attachments to email submissions of full proposals.
6. All projects must include a major component of data mobilization through the GBIF network. It is expected that most BID funding is directed towards data mobilization. As a guideline for the national grants, the amount of BID funding spent on data mobilization activities should not be less than 60% of the total grant.

  + Activities to mobilize biodiversity data
  + Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes
2. The principal investigator and grant coordinator responsible for organizing project activities on behalf of the project collaborators must submit the concept note. The grant coordinator must be a legal entity located in an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries).
3. Projects must involve users of biodiversity data as project partners, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. These must be representatives of legal entities located in an [eligible Pacific ACP country](../eligible-countries). A letter of support for the project must be provided from at least one data user.
4. All projects must include a major component of data mobilization through the GBIF network. It is expected that most BID funding is directed towards data mobilization.
