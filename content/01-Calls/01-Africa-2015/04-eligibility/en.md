# Eligibility

----------
In addition to meeting role-dependent location requirements in an [eligible country](/about/eligible-countries), organizations seeking funding through the BID programme must meet both general and grant-specific eligibility requirements outlined below. 

+ [General eligibility criteria](#general)
+ [Regional grant eligibility](#regional)
+ [National grant eligibility](#national)
+ [Small grant eligibility](#small)

## General eligibility criteria<a name="general"></a>

All applications for BID grants must comply with the following general eligibility criteria:

1. Complete concept notes and full proposals in English must be received by the stated deadlines.
2. All confirmed project partners must have completed [one of the BID surveys](http://www.gbif.org/news/surveys-for-data-holders-decision-makers). These surveys are aimed at decision-makers and biodiversity data holders in the African ACP countries and seek to understand biodiversity data needs and resources in the region
3. Applicants must be legal entities located in an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). Such entities include national government agencies, GBIF Participant nodes, natural history museums and collections, research institutes, universities, and NGOs.
4. Applications involving partners from countries or organizations that already participate in GBIF must include a statement of endorsement from the GBIF Head of Delegation or Node Manager. Contact information for representatives of GBIF Participant countries and organizations can be found on the Participant pages linked from the [Participant list](http://www.gbif.org/participation/participant-list).
All BID funded activities must be not-for-profit. BID programme funds may be used to support staff time, travel and costs associated with the organization of meetings and workshops, and limited costs for IT services and equipment.
6. Overhead costs may not be charged to BID grants.
7. Applicants must commit cofunding (in-kind or cash) to their projects and provide details of this cofunding in their concept notes and full proposals. Cofunding refers to real costs that are incurred by the applicants while executing the funded project’s activities. These could be in-kind contributions that directly contribute to the project activities (like staff salaries, travel costs etc.) or any in-cash contributions to BID activities from other funding sources.
8. All proposed project activities must fall within the stated implementation periods for each grant type.
9. Applicants must provide plans to ensure sustainability of activities after project support from BID concludes.
10. All data mobilized through the BID grants, as well as any other products of the projects, such as training material, must be made available under a [CC-BY license or CC0 license](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/data-licensing-and-endorsement).

## Regional grant eligibility<a name="regional"></a>

In addition to complying with the [general eligibility criteria](#general) above, applications for regional biodiversity data mobilization grants must comply with the following criteria:

1. All projects must include activities contributing to each of the three component categories:
+ Establishing or strengthening networks to support long-term data mobilization and inter-institutional data sharing
+ Activities to mobilize biodiversity data
+ Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes
2. Applications must be submitted by the consortium coordinator that will coordinate the project activities on behalf of the consortium partners and other project collaborators. The consortium coordinator must be a legal entity from an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). The consortium coordinator may apply for additional support for activities related to the coordination of the consortium, up to a maximum of €10,000. Applications must explain how the consortium coordinator will coordinate the activities of the partners.
3. Applications must include at least three consortium partners including the consortium coordinator, each from a different African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). All consortium partners must have confirmed their participation in the project and must be copied when concept notes and full proposals are submitted.
4. In addition to the three consortium partners from African ACP countries, projects may choose to include one consortium partner that is a legal entity located in one of the eligible countries listed in [Annex A, Section 2 + 3](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf). This non-ACP consortium partner can receive a maximum of €10,000. Their involvement in the project should be focused on capacity enhancement for the regional consortium. They may also include some activities to mobilize biodiversity data where relevant in the context of the activities by the regional consortium. Non-ACP consortium partners may not apply for costs related to IT services or purchases.
5. Projects must involve users of biodiversity data as project partners or collaborators, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. These must be representatives of legal entities located in an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)).
6. All projects must include a major component of data mobilization through the GBIF network. It is expected that most BID funding is directed towards data mobilization. As a guideline for the regional grants, the amount of BID funding spent on data mobilization activities should not be less than 60% of the total grant.
7. BID funds may be used to cover up to 50% of the costs of any IT services or purchases, up to a maximum of €2,500 for each consortium partner located in an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). Receipts will need to be provided in financial reports.

## National grant eligibility<a name="national"></a>

In addition to complying with the [general eligibility criteria](#general) above, applications for national biodiversity data mobilization grants must comply with the following criteria:
1. All projects must include activities contributing to each of the three component categories:
• Capacity enhancement of national biodiversity information facilities
• Activities to mobilize biodiversity data
• Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes
2. Applications must be submitted by the project coordinator that will coordinate the project activities on behalf of the project partners. The project coordinator must be a legal entity from an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). The project coordinator will be responsible for managing the grant and for the project reporting.
3. Applications must include at least two relevant national institutes, agencies or non-governmental organizations as project partners.
4. Projects must involve users of biodiversity data as project partners, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. These must be representatives of legal entities located in an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)).
5. All confirmed project partners must be copied when concept notes and full proposals are submitted. Letters of support from confirmed project partners should be included as attachments to email submissions of project applications.
6. All projects must include a major component of data mobilization through the GBIF network. It is expected that most BID funding is directed towards data mobilization. As a guideline for the national grants, the amount of BID funding spent on data mobilization activities should not be less than 60% of the total grant.
7. BID funds may be used to cover up to 50% of the costs of any IT services or purchases, up to a maximum of €2,500 of any national grant. Receipts will need to be provided in financial reports.

## Small grant eligibility<a name="small"></a>

In addition to complying with the [general eligibility criteria](#general) above, applications for small biodiversity data mobilization grants must comply with the following criteria:

1. All projects must include activities contributing to the first component category and may also include activities contributing to the second component category:
+ Activities to mobilize biodiversity data
+ Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes
