## Survey for data holders and decision makers in the Pacific

GBIF is seeking input from two stakeholder groups critical to the long-term success of the BID programme: data holders and decision makers. 

Applicants seeking funding under this call for proposals, including their proposed project partners, are required to complete the appropriate survey. 

**Data holders** need resources and incentives to distribute the many types of information that they steward. 

[What financial or technical challenges do you face in sharing data for use in research and policy?](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/J8T7C6B)

**Decision makers** depend on high-quality biodiversity information to support planning and policy and to encourage world-class research. 

[How well do you feel that your information needs are currently served?](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/J87WFXS)
