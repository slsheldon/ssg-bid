## On completing specific sections of the concept note template

### What are the issues that this project seeks to address?

Describe the relevant background and context for your project, indicating the key needs targeted by the project (250 words maximum).

### Who will collaborate on the project?

#### Lead partner and main contact person

The project coordinator is the legal entity that will manage the grant and coordinate the activities on behalf of the project partners. A main contact person should be identified. 

The lead partner should be identified by writing “YES” in the column ‘Lead partner’ in table 4. There can only be ONE institution identified as lead partner.

#### Other project partners 

Small grants target mobilization of biodiversity data relevant for biodiversity conservation priorities. GBIF recommends including project partners from data holding or using institutions or networks involved in the project’s activities.

National grants target the establishment or strengthening of national biodiversity information facilities. GBIF recommends including project partners from as wide a range of relevant national institutes, agencies or non-governmental organizations as possible, such as holders of botanical and zoological data, and observation data and collections data. Remember that projects must involve at least two relevant national institutes, agencies or non-governmental organizations as project partners, as well as including users of biodiversity data as project partners, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. 

Regional grants target the establishment or strengthening of international collaborations that increase long-term biodiversity data mobilization and inter-institutional data sharing. Besides consortium partners, GBIF recommends including other project partners from other data holding or using institutions or networks.

It is acceptable to list project partners that have not yet confirmed their participation in the project at the concept note stage. All partners will need to confirm their involvement in the project in the full proposal. Remember to copy all confirmed project partners on email submissions. 

### What activities will be included in the project?

This section should describe the proposed activities and how they will produce the deliverables (500 words maximum). The project partner(s) responsible for each activity should also be identified.

### Why are these  the right activities to address the issues?

This section should describe how the proposed activities (e.g. data mobilization, data publishing workshops, etc.) listed under question #5 are expected to address the issue identified under question #3 (maximum 400 words). Major risks associated with the activities should be identified and possible ways to address these should be described in this section.

### What will the project deliver?

Use this section to list the main deliverables of the project. The deliverables should be tangible and achievable within the project’s implementation period. BID projects are expected to deliver lasting results in one or more of these areas: data on species in the region made freely accessible online via GBIF.org; increased capacity for biodiversity information management; establishment of national/regional biodiversity information facilities (maximum 400 words).

-----------------------

### On eligibility

#### Can an institution submit a proposal for gathering new data?
 
The BID programme focuses on mobilizing existing biodiversity data, rather than supporting new data gathering from the field. It will support the work required to mobilize the data, with emphasis on ensuring that the data are of sufficient quality to be published to the GBIF network and to enable their reuse in targeted use cases in research and decision-making.

-----------------------

### On the proposed budget

Please provide estimates of the anticipated cost of the proposed activities by indicating how much funding will be required from the BID programme and how much co-funding will be provided by each partner. 

Co-funding refers to real costs incurred by the project partners while executing the funded project’s activities. These could be in-kind contributions directly contributing to the project activities (like staff salaries, travel costs etc.) or any in-cash contributions to BID activities from other funding sources. BID grantees will be expected to report on cofunding in their financial reporting. The budget should be provided in Euro.

-----------------------

## On forming consortia and partnerships

### What are the minimum and maximum number of partners in a regional consortium?

A minimum of three partners is required in the regional consortium. These three partners must be legal entities from three different Caribbean ACP countries. There is no upper limit for the number of consortium members.

### Can multiple national partners receive funds under the regional grant consortium?

The BID call for proposals states that one of the objectives of the regional grants is to ‘establish or strengthen international collaborations to mobilize biodiversity data’. The focus of this grant type is therefore on the international collaboration, and the requirement of having a least three consortium partners coming from different ACP country should be met. If more than one national partner is included in a regional consortium (with funding of not more than €20,000 for each partner), the proposal should specify the particular impact/contribution of each partner to the international collaboration.

### Can private companies be involved as partners in any of the BID grants?

Commercial enterprises can be part of the consortia in national and regional BID projects but are excluded from receiving funds under the BID programme. The recommendation would be for private companies to co-fund the activity, for example by covering costs of their involvement if any.

### Can a GBIF node or other institution in a non-ACP country be a partner in a BID proposal for national or small grants without requesting funds?

Yes, institutions, including GBIF nodes, in non-ACP countries can be project partners in BID proposals for national and small grants without requesting funds. Additionally, partners must ensure that the costs associated with the participation of the non-ACP partner may not be covered from BID funds.

### What type of institution can lead a national biodiversity data mobilization grant?

The institution that should lead the ‘national biodiversity data mobilization grants’ as the project coordinator. Some of the best examples of partnerships dealing with biodiversity information management come from the GBIF network. Participation in GBIF is not a requirement for applying to the BID call for proposals. However, the GBIF Secretariat would recommend treating the partnerships in a national grant as a national biodiversity information facility, coordinated by a  proto GBIF Participant Node.

Section 6.1 of [*Establishing an Effective GBIF Participant Node*](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80925) explains the selection of an institutional location for a node. The chapter includes potential advantages and disadvantages of selecting various types of host institutions, based on their mandates. The recommendation is that the same rationale be followed in choosing the coordinator for a national grant under the BID call for proposals.
 
### Can a country programme/office of an international organization apply for a BID grant?

A country programme of an international organization can participate in a BID grant if it is registered as a distinct legal entity in an [eligible Caribbean ACP countries](../eligible-countries).
 
-----------------------

## On eligible countries

### Can institutions and agencies based in non-ACP countries be partners in the consortium applying for BID grants?

In the case of regional biodiversity data mobilization grants, in addition to the minimum of three consortium partners from [eligible Caribbean ACP countries](../eligible-countries), projects may choose to include one consortium partner that is a legal entity located EITHER in section 2 or section 3 of the list of [eligible Caribbean ACP countries](../eligible-countries).
 
-----------------------

## On future calls for proposals

### Will there be a second call for BID proposals from the Caribbean?

No, this is the one and only call for proposals for this region and the Pacific. A second call for sub-Saharan Africa is planned for 2017.
