# BID community members

This list can help you find others currently involved in the BID programme for project partnerships, mentoring opportunities or general assistance. Find [BID mentors](#mentors) and [GBIF staff](#gbifs) below. The members of the wider BID community can be reached through the [BID mailing list](../mailing-lists/).

The BID community relies on the expertise that already resides within the GBIF network. GBIF will award digital badges to individuals to certify their contributions to the programme. [Learn about the project roles and badges](#badges).

Please send corrections and updates to your personal information to [bid@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org).

## <a name="badges"></a>Roles and badges

GBIF plans to award the following badges in support of the BID programme: 
+ **Volunteer mentor**: Those supporting BID applicants and grantees in the design and implementation of their projects, including providing online, on-site and training support
+ **Project participant**: Those who meet criteria recognizing substantial contributions to a project funded by BID
+ **Online mentor**: Those having demonstrated sufficient experience and commitment while supporting project grantees through online mechanisms
+ **On-site mentor**: Those who travel to support BID project participants through on-site mentoring actions
+ **Trainer**: Those mentors involved in the development of training resources and the implementation of training events
+ **Community manager**: Those who ensure that smooth operation and optimal use of resources within the BID community

GBIF also expects to make training available through BID that would award [badges designed earlier](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/GBIF-digital-badges) for those who complete training in "Biodiversity data mobilization" and "Biodiversity data analysis and use".

## <a name="mentors"></a>Mentors

Mentors are a pillar of the BID community. They actively contribute their knowledge and expertise while collaborating directly with project teams. In return, they get unique access to opportunities for engaging other biodiversity informatics experts and helping to establish or enhance biodiversity information facilities. Activities include participation in webinars, capacity enhancement workshops and networking opportunities with project team members and other partners. 

Those interested in joining the current mentors can review the [official call for BID mentors](http://bid.gbif.org/raw/call-for-BID-volunteer-mentors.pdf), learn more about the role's benefits and responsibilities, or go directly to [the application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1R3EmHdZxt6ZoTJ9e43SeOG7Rl3awNidaLN-pdmbCFZQ/viewform).
